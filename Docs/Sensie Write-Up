Sensie Write-Up

The Sensie is a low-cost, Nordic NRF24-based wireless sensor board.  For true sensor mass-acceptance, the price of sensor boards needs to be as low as possible.  My target for this project was to hit a per-board total cost, including Nordic Module, of $7.

The Sensie has the following features:

- iPod-charger powerable
- Battery-powerable with JST PH-header

- USB serial console
- RTC for periodic sampling

- Easily-accessible sensor headers
- Ability to disable power to analog sensors
- External counter pin

- Drop-in BMP085 Barometer support
- Drop-in Bluetooth module support

- Fully wirelessly controllable sensors
- A Beaglebone-based management interface
